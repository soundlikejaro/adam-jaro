                    <p>I've finally cut my ties with Adobe and am free of paying £70 a month or whatever for software that constantly crashes and pisses everyone off. Affinity and Davinci resolve are seemingly all you need.</p>
                    <p>But this also means I've lost my adobe portfolio site - but luckily AI has come to my rescue and built this stunning site in it's place.</p>
                    <p>I've just been introduced to <a href="https://antigravity.google/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-gray-600">Google Antigravity</a> from a friend and am blown away with how easy it is to develop websites now. I've built sites and tiny rubbish apps with ChatGPT before and it has made things so mucheasier but I still needed some coding knowledge and a bit of effort. With this it's now unbelievably easy.</p>
                    <p>Not sure how much I'll be posting on this blog, but I might use it as a little note-to-self when something creative feels worth sharing my opinion on. So probably not very often at all.</p>
